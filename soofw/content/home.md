Welcome to the wonderful world of soofw. My name is John (aka scizzorz). I'm 20 years old and studying computer science at [Binghamton University](http://binghamton.edu/) in New York. You can email me at <jweachock@gmail.com>.

This site serves as my code playground and experimental zone. I like playing around with new stuff, so the site is usually under construction. In the meantime, I use it to express my [thoughts](Http://soofw.com/thoughts/) and try to produce useful content for people. In general, I try to post things that *I* would like to read about: tools I'm using, my personalized settings, opinions on things, design decisions, work styles, etc. and the rationale behind all of those things. I find that reading about the experiences of other people has certainly influenced the way I work and helped me to become better at the things I do, so I try to replicate that effect and hope that I help someone else find a new tool or learn something new. I have a section to showcase my [personal projects](http://soofw.com/projects/), because I like to see what others have made as well. There's a small corner dedicated to interesting articles over [here](http://soofw.com/links/), and there's a long list of HTML5 canvas demos over [here](http://soofw.com/demos/).

I hope you enjoy your visit!

I'm a fan of [Android](http://www.android.com/) and [Linux](http://www.linux.org/). I have a [Samsung Galaxy Nexus](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SPH-L700ZKASPR) and a [Google Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/7/) (2013 model); my phone runs [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) 10.1 nightlies. My desktop is running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/) 11 Waldorf with two monitors and a [mechanical keyboard](http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-blackwidow-ultimate), because mechanical keyboards are *awesome*. I designed and built my desk with programming and brainstorming in mind; as a result, the desktop surface is a whiteboard. I have a [Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/landing.html) that I use when I'm out and about, and a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) for fun. I use [Linode](http://www.linode.com/) for my production servers, and [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for my development and staging machines. I try to host most of my code and configurations on my [GitHub](https://github.com/scizzorz), although any confidential or private code is located on my own [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/).

I use [Openbox](http://openbox.org/) as my window manager. I use `gnome-terminal` on my desktop and [Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en) on my Chromebook, both with a custom [color scheme](https://github.com/scizzorz/dots/blob/master/terminal-palette). I use `bash` as my shell and [`tmux`](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) to make it useful. For editing text of any sort, I use [`vim`](http://www.vim.org/). I use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for version control on all of my projects. I prefer to use [Python](http://www.python.org/) for most of my programming, although I have plenty of experience with [PHP](http://www.php.net/), JavaScript, [Java](http://www.java.com/). I'm also proficient with SQL, C/C++, Lua, HTML5, and CSS3, and I'm in the process of learning [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell). I've tinkered with [Android app development](http://developer.android.com/index.html), [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), woodworking, etc., but a lot of my free time goes into web programming and scripting neat toys.

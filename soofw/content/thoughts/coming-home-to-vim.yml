  I've read countless articles about using Vim, why to use Vim instead of other editors, how to make the big switch, etc. Among all of those articles, however, this is definitely one of the most thorough and comprehensive articles that I've read on the subject. Along with being fairly descriptive and explanatory, it doesn't disappoint when it comes to the things I've come to expect from Vim articles: an exciting and heart-warming tale about the author's struggle as they transition from a standard text editor to Vim's modal editing, and a list of useful features and commands that the author has collected in their time with Vim.

Everyone seems to think that just because I like to write code that I want to do it for my career. I don't.

I don't really like programming for other people. They always have their rules and demands and they always seem to get in my way. I hate it when my creativity is restricted by other people. I want to program for fun or to make my life easier. I don't want to sit there and dawdle while someone lists all of the requirements that I'm going to have to meet like a teacher giving students an assignment. Boring.

I want to be a designer and an innovator. I don't want to be trapped by standards and rules; I want to make new things and do things that haven't been done. Technology is expanding quickly and lowering the barrier of entry to that sort of thing. These days, I don't have to have years of experience in a garbage programming job to get an enjoyable job or to make a living. All I have to do is make a high-quality, unique, and awesome app or game for smartphones and hope that the ever-expanding reach of app stores will help propel it.

> I don't have to follow the familiar standards of whatever kind of app I'm building. I don't have to use an existing application as a model. I can disregard history. I can develop solutions without people saying "That's not how it's supposed to work!"

  After about a week's worth of effort, I've finally got a functioning version of soofw based on a Python and [mod_wsgi](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/). I wrote my own framework system to get a better understanding of the web environment for Python, but I'm not entirely confident it's the best solution for my needs. Earlier today I finished importing all of the legacy posts to the new system and flipped the switch to transition from PHP to Python.

  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. It felt pretty satisfying every time I got a piece to click into place. Python made it easy and quick to implement all of the features of the previous version plus some new ones. I wrote the new system with the eventual goal of open-sourcing it on GitHub, but at the moment it's a little... messy. I'd like to spend some time with it clean it up and get a chance to see where it misses the mark. I can already tell that it's a much more powerful and flexible setup than my old PHP, so I'm pretty hopeful.

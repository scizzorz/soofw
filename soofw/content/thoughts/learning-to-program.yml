  So you want to learn to program? Great! It's an absurdly [powerful](http://programmingzen.com/2011/03/21/programming-is-a-super-power/) and [beautiful](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2008/08/beauty-in-computer-science-recursion/) hobby to pick up. Unfortunately, it can be pretty difficult to pick up on some of the fundamental concepts if you aren't a "natural" programmer, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Being able to program, in my opinion, is an unbelievable and unparalleled skill. As a programmer, you can take plain old thoughts, organize them into a few dozen (or more) lines of code, and it will actually *do* something. You can imagine a red ball bouncing across the screen and actually [make a red ball bouncing across the screen](http://soofw.com/up/ball/). And you don't need anything more than a computer, which I'm assuming you have if you're reading this article: you can do all of that with just [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/g9qjd/3/). It's incredible. All of this amazing potential is right at your fingertips; all of the groundwork has already been laid out for you to make amazing things. All you have to do is learn how. So... how do you do that?

After spending a few torturous hours of being terrible at all things related to music, my synthesizer contraption finally works. I'll get around to adding some controls for tempo and whatnot eventually, but  I'm tired and it <span style="text-decoration: line-through">works as is</span> doesn't really work that well for everyone. [Enjoy](/sound/).

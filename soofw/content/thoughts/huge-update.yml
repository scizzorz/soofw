  Well, well, well... where to start. I've added a few new features to the site and made a ton of changes in the source. Here's really simple changelog:

  * **SCSS instead of CSS** &#8210; oh my god why have I never used this before.
  * **Some CSS3 transitions** &#8210; just because they're neat.
  * **[Projects page](http://soofw.com/projects)** &#8210; for my personal projects and whatnot.
  * **[Demos page](http://soofw.com/demos) style update** &#8210; to be more readable and consistent with the projects page.
  * **New page header** &#8210; you know, up there ^^^ for navigating the site and stuff.
  * **No JavaScript** &#8210; I had some JavaScript loading on each page for no particular reason... now I don't!
  * **[New error page](http://soofw.com/four-oh-four)** &#8210; because I needed one.
  * **Refactored code** &#8210; because I needed to.
  * **Almost open source** &#8210; the code is almost reaching a level where I feel comfortable letting everyone in the whole world see it.

  *The end.*

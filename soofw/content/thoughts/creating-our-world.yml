  Sometimes I take a step back and actually think about everything I interact with on a daily basis. My computer is capable of billions of computations per second and can connect with millions (billions?) of other devices just like it through some magic cables that run all over the planet. I can fit an [entire computer](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) in my pocket. My [phone](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Galaxy_Nexus_HSPA?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa&hl=en) is essentially a complete computer as well, and it can literally communicate with anywhere in the world just *through the air.*

  I can wake up warm, dry, and safe every morning in a giant wooden structure. I can buy a digital piece of paper on my phone before I get out of bed. After getting out of bed, I can hop in the shower and have clean water rain down from a magic tube. I can eat food that was made hundreds of miles away and delivered to my house. I can then get in a self-propelled, hollow, metal box with wheels and use it to travel several miles to an airport. From there, I can climb aboard a long metal tube with wings and *take off **into the sky,*** arriving at my destination within a few hours. It's absolutely incredible to me.

  How did these inventions come about? How is it even *possible* to create something with that magnitude of complexity? I struggle managing a mere several thousand lines of code or a dozen wires. I cannot even comprehend how people, even hundreds of them working together, could create something as complicated as an airplane, or a home, or a CPU, or an office building, or *anything I have ever used.* How did we fly to the moon?! I simply cannot understand it.

  What's even more amazing is that so much of this advancement has taken place in less than a century. The [Ford Model T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_T), the first affordable automobile, was produced in 1908. The [Wright brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Brothers#Flights) made their first flight in 1903. The [first programmable computer](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000984.htm) didn't exist until 1936. We [landed on the moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11) in 1969. How on earth have these inventions become so popular so quickly? How did we go from a computer that can [compute one operation per second](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/z/z1.htm) to one that can computer [3.47 billion operations per second in *each of its six cores*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i7_microprocessors#.22Gulftown.22_.2832_nm.29) in less than 80 years? How did we come so far in such a small amount of time?

  It's truly an incredible time to be alive. Don't forget that.

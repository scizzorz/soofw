  Welcome to the wonderful world of soofw. My name is John (aka scizzorz). I'm
  studying computer science at [Binghamton University](http://binghamton.edu/)
  in New York. You can contact me at <jweachock@gmail.com>.

  This site serves as my code playground and experimental zone. I like playing
  around with new stuff, so the site is usually under construction. In the
  meantime, I use it to express my [thoughts](Http://soofw.com/thoughts/) and
  try to produce useful content for people. In general, I try to post things
  that *I* would like to read about: tools I'm using, my personalized settings,
  opinions on things, design decisions, work styles, etc. and the rationale
  behind all of those things. I find that reading about the experiences of
  other people has certainly influenced the way I work and helped me to become
  better at the things I do, so I try to replicate that effect and hope that I
  help someone else find a new tool or learn something new. I have a section to
  showcase my [personal projects](http://soofw.com/projects/), because I like to
  see what others have made as well. There's a small corner dedicated to
  interesting articles over <span style="text-decoration:
  line-through">here</span> at [Delicious](https://delicious.com/scizzorz), and
  there's a long list of HTML5 canvas demos over
  [here](http://soofw.com/demos/).

  I hope you enjoy your visit!

  I'm a fan of Android and Linux. I have a Moto X and a Google Nexus 7 (2013),
  both running stock Android 4.4. My desktop is running Crunchbang 11 Waldorf
  with two monitors and a Razer BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard, because
  mechanical keyboards are *awesome*. I designed and built my desk with
  programming and brainstorming in mind; as a result, the desktop surface is a
  whiteboard. I have an HP Chromebook 11 that I use when I'm out and about, and
  a small cluster of seven Raspberry Pis that, uhh, do... nothing.  I use
  [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4cd3d58287ae) as my
  primary server hosting.  I try to host most of my code and configurations on
  my [GitHub](https://github.com/scizzorz), although any confidential or
  private code is located on my own instance of [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/).

  I use Openbox as my window manager. I use `urxvt` as my desktop terminal and
  [Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en)
  on my Chromebook, both with a custom [color
  scheme](https://github.com/scizzorz/dots/blob/master/terminal-palette). I use
  `bash` as my shell and `tmux` to make it more useful. For editing text of any
  sort, I use `vim`. I use Git for version control on all of my projects. I
  prefer to use Python for most of my programming, although I have plenty of
  experience with PHP, JavaScript, and Java. I'm also proficient with SQL,
  C/C++, Lua, HTML5, and CSS3, and I think Haskell is pretty neat. I've
  tinkered with Android app development, Arduino, woodworking, etc., but a lot
  of my free time goes into web programming and scripting neat toys.
